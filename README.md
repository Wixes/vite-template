# Vite template for quick start in React-based application development!

## [Based on default vite application](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

### Basic features includes:

- Prepared [FSD](https://feature-sliced.design/docs) architecture for development
- Configured [MSW v2+](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started) library for creating mocks as if you are working with the network
- [MUI v6]() for speed up development process
- [react-router-dom v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) for client side routing
- [valtio v2](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio) for state management with configured [eslint-plugin-valtio](https://github.com/pmndrs/eslint-plugin-valtio)
- Default eslint rules with sorting import configuration (based on [sort-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports) and [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import))
- Prepared _absolute_ imports resolved by [vite-tsconfig-paths](https://github.com/aleclarson/vite-tsconfig-paths) for making life easier
